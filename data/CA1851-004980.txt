446. Any Court in which an action is pending, or a Judge thereof,
or a County Judge, may, upon notice, o'rder either party to give to the
other within a specified time an inspection and copy, or permission to
take a copy of any book, document, or paper in his possession, or under
his control, containing evidence relating to the merits of the action, or
the defense therein. If compliance with the order be refused, the
Court may exclude the book, document, or paper, from being given in
evidence; or if wanted as evidence by the party applying, may direct
the jury to presume it to Much as he alleges it to be; and the Court
may also punish the party refusing for a contempt. This section shall
not be construed to prevent a party from compelling another to produce
1300'â€œ, papers, or documents, when he is examined as a witness.
