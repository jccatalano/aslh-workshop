173. When the verdict is given, and is not informal or insufficient,
the Clerk shall immediately record it, in full, in the minutes, and shall
read it to the jury, and inquire of them whether it be their verdict. If
any juror disagree, the jury shall be again sent out; but if no disagreement be expressed, the verdict shall be complete, and the jury shall be
discharged from the case.
