308. The costs of partition, including fees of referees and other
disbursements, shall be paid by the parties respectively entitled to share
in the lands divided, in proportion to their respective interests therein,
and may be included and specified in the judgment. In that case they
shall be a lien on the several shares, and the judgment may be enforced
by execution against such shares, and against other property held by the
respective parties. When, however, a litigation arises between some of
the parties only, the Court may require the expense of such litigation to
be paid by the parties thereto, or any of them.
