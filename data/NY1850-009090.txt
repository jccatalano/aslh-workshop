825. Satisfaction of a judgment may be entered in the clerkâ€™s register and docket, upon an execution returned satisfied, or upon an acknowledgment of satisfaction filed with the clerk, made in the manner of an acknowledgment of a conveyance of real property, by the judgment creditor, or within two years after the judgment, by the attorney, unless a revocation of his authority is previously entered upon the register. Whenever a judgment is satisfied in fact, otherwise than upon an execution, it is the duty of the party or attorney to give such acknowledgment, and upon motion, the court may compel it, or may order the entry of satisfaction to be made without it. And whenever a judgment is satisfied in fact as to any one of several defendants, an entry to that effect may be made in the register and docket.
