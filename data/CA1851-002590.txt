237. If the purchaser of real property sold on execution, or his
successor in interest, be evicted therefrom in consequence of irregularity
in the proceedings concerning the sale, or of the reversal or discharge
of the judgment, he may recover the price paid, with interest, from the
judgment creditor. If the recovery be in consequence of the irregularity in the proceedings concerning the sale, the judgment may, by order
of the Court, upon notice to the judgment debtor, be revived, and a new
erecution issued for the price paid on the sale, with interest. Such

judgment shall be a lien on the real estate of the judgment debtor only
from the time of its revival. (
