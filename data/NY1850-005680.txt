521. When an attorney refuses to deliver over money or papers to a person from or for whom he has received them in the course of professional employment, whether in an action or not, he may be required by an order of the court in which an action, if any, was prosecuted, or if no action were prosecuted, then by an order of the supreme court, to do so within a specified time, or show cause why he should not be punished for a contempt.
