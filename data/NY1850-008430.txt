764. At any time after issue, and at least ten days before the court, either party may give notice of trial. The party giving the notice must furnish the clerk, at least four days before the court, with a note of the issue, containing the title of the action, the names of the attorneys, and the time when the last pleading was served; and the clerk must thereupon enter the cause upon the calendar, according to the date of the issue. The issues, once placed upon the calendar of a circuit or special term, if not tried at the circuit or term for which the notice was given, need not be noticed for a subsequent circuit or term, but must remain upon the calendar, from court to court, until finally disposed of. But when an issue of law is to be tried before a judge out of court, no calendar need be made or note of issue furnished.
