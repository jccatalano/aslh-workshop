By the plaintifff himself at any time before trial, if a provisional remedy has not been allowed, or counterclaim made: 2. By either party, with the written consent of the other: 3. By the court, when, upon the trial and before the final submission of the case the plaintifff abandons it: 4. By the court, when the plaintifff fails to appear on the trial, and the defendant appears and asks for the dismissal: 5. By the court, on the application of some of the defendants, when there are others whom the plaintifff fails to prosecute with diligence. All other modes of dismissing an action by non-suit, or otherwise, are abolished.
