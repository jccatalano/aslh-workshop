The commission may be issued by the clerk under the seal of the court, or a surrogate, or by a justice in their courts, on the application of either party, upon five daysâ€™ previous notice to the other. It must be issued to a person agreed upon by the parties, or if they do not agree, to a judge or justice of the peace, selected by the officer issuing it. Such proper interrogatories, direct and cross, as the respective parties may prepare, to be settled by the clerk or justice in a summary manner, if the parties disagree, may be annexed to the commission, or when the parties agree to that mode, the examination maybe without written interrogatories.
