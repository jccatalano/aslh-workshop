1042. Execution cannot be issued on a judgment, mentioned in sections 1038 and 1040, without leave of the court, nor must leave be granted, until the court is satisfied that payment has been demanded of the proper county, or town officers, as provided in the last two sections, and that the board of supervisors have wrongfully omitted to include the amount in the tax list, as provided in section 1039. When execution is issued, the property of the county, or town, only is liable thereon.
