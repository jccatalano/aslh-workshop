223. All sales of property under execution shall be made at
auction to the highest bidder, and shall be made between the hours of
nine in the morning and live in the afternoon ; after sufficient property
has been sold to satisfy the execution, no more shall be sold. Neither
the officer holding the execution, nor his deputy, shall become a
purchaser, or be interested in any purchase at such sale. When the
sale is of personal property, capable of manual delivery, it shall be
within view of those who attend the sale, and be sold in such parcels as
are likely to bring the highest price; and when the sale is of real
property, and consisting of several known lots or parcels, they shall be
sold separately; or when a portion of such real property is claimed by
a third person, and he requires it to be sold separately, such portion
shall be thus sold. The judgment debtor, if present at the sale, may
also direct the order in which property, real or personal, shall be
sold, when such property consists of several known lots or parcels, or of articles which can be sold to advantage separately ; and the Sheriff shall
be bound to follow such directions.
