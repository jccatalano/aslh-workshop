128. Any person owing debts to the defendant, or having in his
possession, or under his control, any credits or other personal property
belonging to the defendant, may be required to attend before the Court
or Judge, and be examined on oath respecting the same. The defendant may also be required to attend for the purpose of giving
information respecting his property, and may be examined on oath.
The Court or Judge may, after such examination, order personal property
capable of manual delivery, to be delivered to the Sheriff on such terms
as may be just, having reference to any liens thereon, or claims against
the same, and a memorandum to be given of all other personal property,
containing the amount and description thereof.
