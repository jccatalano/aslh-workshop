669. Any pleading may be once amended by the party of course, without, costs, and without prejudice to the proceedings already had, at any time before the period for answering it expires, or, if it do not delay the trial, it can be so amended at any time within twenty days after service of the answer to such pleading. In such case a copy of the amended pleading must be served on the adverse party. After the decision of a demurrer, either at a general or special term, the court may, in its discretion, if it appear that the demurrer was interposed in good faith, allow the defendant to answer, upon such terms as to trial by the court or referees, or as to costs, or otherwise, as may be just.
