1122. The justice, on the demand of a party in whose favor judgment is rendered, must give him a transcript thereof, which may be filed and docketed in the office of the clerk of the county where the judgment was rendered. The time of the receipt of the transcript by the county clerk, must be noted by him thereon, and entered in the docket; and from that time, the judgment creates a lien in the same manner, as a judgment of the supreme court. Upon a transcript of such docket, certified by the clerk of the county, and filed in any other county, the judgment may be there docketed with the same effect, from the time of filing and docketing in that county. The judgment so docketed, and the enforcement thereof, are subject to the control of the county court of the county where it was first docketed, as a judgment of that court. But a judgment for less than twenty-five dollars, so docketed, is not a lien upon, and cannot be enforced against real property.
