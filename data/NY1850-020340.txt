1862. The following are the rules, for construing the descriptive part of a conveyance of real property, when the construction is doubtful, and there are no other sufficient circumstances to determine it: 1. Where there are certain definite and ascertained particulars in the description, the addition of others, which are indefinite, unknown or false, does not frustrate the conveyance, but it is to be construed by the first mentioned particulars: 2. When permanent and visible, or ascertained boundaries or monuments, are inconsistent with the measurement, either of lines, angles or surfaces, the boundaries or monuments are paramount: 3. Between different measurements, which are inconsistent with each other, that of angles is paramount to that of surfaces, and that of lines, paramount to both: 4. When a road, or a stream of water not navigable, is the boundary, the rights of the grantor to the middle of the road, or the thread of the stream, are included in the conveyance, except where the road or bed of the stream is held under another title; 5. When tide water is the boundary, the rights of the grantor to low water mark are included in the conveyance: 6. When the description refers to a map, and that reference is inconsistent with other particulars, it controls them, if it appear, that the parties acted with reference to the map; otherwise the map is subordinate to other definite, and ascertained particulars.
