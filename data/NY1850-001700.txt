152. The courts known as the courts of justices of the peace, the justices’ courts of the cities of Albany, Hudson and Troy, and the justices’ courts of the several justices’ districts in the city of New-York, are continued, with the jurisdiction conferred by the next three sections, and no other, and are in this code denominated justices’ courts. But nothing contained in this section affects their jurisdiction in actions or proceedings now pending therein, nor does it affect any judgment or order already made, or proceeding already taken.
