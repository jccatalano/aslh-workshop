323. A trial jury, when required in a special proceeding before a judicial officer, as provided in this code, must be drawn as follows: 1. If before a justice of the peace or of a justice’s court, from the justice’s undrawn jury box: 2. If before any other judicial officer, from the undrawn jury box of the county in which the trial is to be had. But if it be before a judge elected in a city, the clerk must return to the box, every ballot containing the name of a person not stated therein to reside in the city in which the trial is to be had.
