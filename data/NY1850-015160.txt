IN place of payment of the purchase money to the sheriff, the purchaser may deliver to him the receipt of the owner of the mortgage thereforee, to the extent of the amount due him thereon, which receipt must be returned with the papers to the judge, on the application for confirmation. The sheriff, and his sureties, shall be responsible for all monies paid to him on such sale, in the same manner as for money collected on execution, and he must dispose of such money as the judge may direct.
