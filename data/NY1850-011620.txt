1063. Parties in justicesâ€™ courts may prosecute or defend in person or by attorney, and any person may act as attorney, except that the constable by whom the summons or jury process was served, cannot appear or act on the trial in behalf of either party. He may however act, in any other stage of the action, as agent or attorney for a party, and the authority of a person to act for another as attorney, may be oral or written, but unless admitted by the adverse party must be proved by the oath of the attorney or otherwise.
