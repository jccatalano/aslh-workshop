902. When in case of a lease of real property, and the failure of the tenant to pay rent, the landlord has a subsisting right to re-enter for such failure, he may bring an action to recover possession of the property; and such action is equivalent to a demand of the rent and a re-entry upon the property. But if at any time before the expiration of six months after possession obtained by the plaintifff, on recovery in the action, the lessee, or his successor in interest as to the whole or part of the property, pay to the plaintifff, or bring into court, the amount of rent then in arrear with interest, and the costs of the action, and perform the other covenants on the part of the lessee, he may be restored to the possession and hold the property according to the terms of the original lease.
