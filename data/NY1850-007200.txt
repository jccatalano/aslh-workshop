It is not necessary for a party to set forth in a pleading the items of an account therein alleged, where they exceed twenty in number, but he must deliver to the adverse party, within ten days, after a demand thereof in writing, a copy of the account verified by his own oath, or that of his agent or attorney, to the effect that he believes it to be true, or be precluded from giving evidence thereof. The court, or a judge thereof, or a county judge, may order a further account, when the one delivered is defective.
