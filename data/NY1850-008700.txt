790. The verdict of a jury is either general or special. A general verdict, is that by which they pronounce generally upon all or any of the issues either in favor of the plaintifff or defendant. A special verdict is that by which the jury find the facts only, leaving the judgment to the court. It must present the conclusions of fact as established by the evidence, and not the evidence to prove them, and those conclusions of fact must be so presented, as that nothing remains to the court but to draw from them conclusions of law.
