1769. Every county clerk, and the register of the city and county of New-York, must receive and file in his office, any private writing, delivered to him for that purpose, and give a written receipt thereforee. Such writing must be properly endorsed, so as to indicate its general nature, the names of the parties thereto, and the time of filing, and must be deposited and kept in such office separate from other papers.
