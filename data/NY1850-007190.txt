652. Every pleading must be subscribed by the party, or his attorney, and the complaint, answer and reply, must be verified by the party, his agent or attorney, to the effect that he believes it to be true. The verification must be made, by the affidavit of the party, or, if there be several parties united in interest and pleading together, by one at least of such parties, if such party be within the state and capable of making the affidavit; otherwise the affidavit may be made by the agent or attorney of the party. The affidavit may also be made by the agent or attorney, if the action or defense be founded upon a written instrument for the payment of money only, and such instrument be in the possession of the agent or attorney, or if all the material allegations of the pleading be within the personal knowledge of the agent or attorney. When the affidavit is made by the agent or attorney, it must set forth the reason of his making it. The verification may be omitted, when an admission of the truth of the complaint might subject the party to prosecution for felony. And no pleading, verified as herein required, can be used in a criminal prosecution against the party, as proof of a fact admitted or alleged in such pleading.
