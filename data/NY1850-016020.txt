1468. Every court of justice, except a court of conciliation, and every judicial officer, has power to punish contempts by fine or imprisonment, or both. But when the contempt, is not one of those mentioned in the first or second subdivisions of the last section, or in the first subdivision of section 228, it must appear that the right or remedy of a party to an action, or special proceeding, was defeated or prejudiced thereby, before the contempt can be punished by imprisonment, or by a fine exceeding fifty dollars. Contempts of justicesâ€™ courts are punishable in the manner provided by sections 1150, 1151, 1152, 1153, and 1154.
