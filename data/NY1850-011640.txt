If the infant be plaintifff, the appointment must be made before the summons is issued, upon the application of the infant, if he be of the age of fourteen years or upwards, if under age, upon the application of some relative or friend. The consent in writing of the guardian to be appointed, and to be responsible for costs, if he fail in the action, must be first filed with the justice. 2. If the infant be defendant, the guardian must be appointed at the time the summons is returned, or before the pleadings. It is the right of the infant to nominate his own guardian, if the infant be over fourteen years of age, and the proposed guardian be present, and consent in writing to be appointed.
