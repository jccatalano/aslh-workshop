1885 All statutes, laws and rules, heretofore in force in this state, in any case provided for by this Code, or inconsistent with its provisions, are hereby repealed and abrogated, nor is any such statute, law, or rule, to be deemed retained, because it is consistent with the provisions upon the same subject in this code; but such repeal or abrogation does not revive any former law heretofore repealed, nor does it affect any right already existing or accrued, or any proceeding already taken, except as in this code provided.
