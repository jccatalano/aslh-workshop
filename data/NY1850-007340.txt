666. No variance between the allegation in a pleading and the proof; is to be deemed material, unless it have actually misled the adverse party, to his prejudice in maintaining his action or defense, upon the merits. Whenever it is alleged, that a party has been so misled that fact must be proved to the satisfaction of the court and it must be proved to the satisfaction of the court and it must be shown in what respect he has been misled; and thereupon the court may order the pleading to be amended, upon such terms as may be just.
