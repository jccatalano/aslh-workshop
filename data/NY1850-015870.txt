1455. The pound master must receive and keep in the pound, the beasts so delivered, and unless the same be reclaimed or discharged according to law within six days, sell them, or so many of them as may be necessary, by auction, giving forty-eight hours notice thereof, by advertisement posted at the pound and at the nearest public place. While the beasts remain in the pound their owner may feed them without disturbance. From the proceeds of the sale the pound master, after deducting the amount of his fees and charges of keeping the beasts, and the charges of sale, must pay to the distrainer the damages so certified, with the fees of the fence viewers, and the surplus, if any, to the owner of the beasts. If no owner appear to claim the surplus, within a year after the sale, it must be paid to the overseers of the poor of the city or town for the use of the poor.
