1148. When the sureties of a constable make complaint to a county judge, that such constable has unlawfully converted to his own use, or misapplied, money collected by him as constable, for which they have been sued, or are liable to be sued, such application being verified by oath that they believe it to be true, the county judge must immediately make an order, suspending such constable from the further exercise of his official powers, until he give new security. Such order must be served on the constable, and filed in the office of the town clerk.
