1800. A witness is not obliged to attend for examination upon a deposition, or for cross-examination upon an affidavit, in any other county than that of his residence, or where he is served with the subpoena; nor is a witness obliged to attend for oral examination, before a court or judge out of the county where the witness resides, or is served with the subpoena; except that in case of an action or special proceeding pending in court, a judge thereof, or a judge of the supreme court, or a county judge, upon an affidavit of a party, or his attorney, shewing that the testimony of the witness is material and his attendance necessary, may endorse on the subpoena an order for the attendance of the witness; in which case, the service of such subpoena and order, and the payment of double fees to the witness, are sufficient to require his attendance, in the same manner as if he resided in the county.
