169. If a justice be disqualified from holding the court as provided in section 188, he must, upon the request of either party, file with the county clerk, a certificate, stating the facts constituting the disqualification, and directing that the action be transferred to the justiceâ€™s court of another district designated by him; and it shall be transferred accordingly. If he refuse to do so, the supreme court at a special term in the same judicial district, or a judge thereof, may, upon motion, after due notice, order the transfer to be made.
