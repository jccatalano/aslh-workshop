408. A witness shall answer questions legal and pertinent to the
matter in issue, though his answer may establish a claim against himself; but he need not give an answer which will have a tendency to

subject him to punishment for a felony; nor need give anâ€˜answer which
will have a direct tendency to degrade his character, unless it be to the
very fact in issue, or to a fact from which the fact at issue would be presumed. But a witness shall answer as to the fact of his previous conviction for felony.
