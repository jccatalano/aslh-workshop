1127. When an execution directs the arrest of the debtor for want of sufficient personal chattels, if there be not sufficient subject to levy known to the officer, or if upon demand by the officer of the debtor, he fail to produce sufficient property, the officer may without further delay arrest the defendant. When arrested, the defendant must be conveyed to the common jail of the county, and there be kept in custody until the execution with costs be paid, or he be discharged by due course of law.
