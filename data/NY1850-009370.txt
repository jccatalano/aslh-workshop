851. If the purchaser of real property sold on execution, or his successor in interest, be evicted therefrom in consequence of irregularity in the proceedings concerning the sale, or of the reversal or discharge of the judgment, he may recover the price paid with interest from the judgment creditor. Such judgment creditor, if the recovery was in consequence of the irregularity, shall thereupon be entitled to a new execution on the judgment, for the price paid on the sale with interest; and for that purpose the judgment shall be deemed valid against the judgment debtor, his personal representatives, heirs, or devisees, but not against a purchaser in good faith, or an encumbrancer, whose title  or encumbrance shall have accrued before a levy on such new execution.
