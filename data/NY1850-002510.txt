223. A judge, upon an affidavit showing cause thereforee, may enlarge the time within which any act in an action or special proceeding before him or in his court, must be done, after its commencement and before judgment, except the time within which an appeal must be taken, or may stay proceedings therein, for the purpose of a motion to the court. But the time cannot be enlarged, or the proceedings stayed for more than twenty days, except upon previous notice to the adverse party; and a copy of the affidavit must be served with the order, or the order may be disregarded; and no judge, except the one who tried the cause, unless he be absent from the county or unable to act, can, after a trial by the court or jury, extend the time for preparing a case, exceptions or special verdict, or stay proceedings thereon.
