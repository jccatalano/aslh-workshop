1629. A conveyance by an infant, of real property, owned or held by him, may be ordered by the supreme court in an action in either of the following cases: 1. When the property is held in trust for another: 2. When an agreement to convey the property has been made, and the agreement ought to be specifically performed by the infant. When so ordered, the conveyance is as effectual as if the infant were of full age. But nothing in this chapter affects a sale of infants’ estate when made, as provided in special statutes, by an executor or administrator, upon an order of the surrogate’s court.
