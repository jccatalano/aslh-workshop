580. The pleadings may be amended at any time before the trial,
to supply a deficiency or omission, when by such amendment substantial
justice will be promoted. If the amendment be made after the issue,
and it be made to appear to the satisfaction of the Court, by oath, that
an adjournment is necessary to the adverse party in consequence of such
amendment, an adjournment shall be granted. The Court may also, in
its discretion, require as a condition of an amendment, the payment of
costs to the adverse party, to be fixed by the Court, not exceeding twenty
dollars; but such payment shall not be required unless an adjournment is

made necessary by the amendment; nor shall an adjournment be allowed
after a witness is sworn on the trial, when an adjournment thereby will
be made necessary.
