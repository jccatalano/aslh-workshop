1483. Whenever, by the provisions of this chapter, an officer is required to keep a person arrested in actual custody, and to bring him before a court or officer, the inability, from illness or otherwise, of the person to attend is a sufficient excuse for not bringing him up. Nor can the officer be required to confine a person arrested upon the warrant in a prison, or otherwise to restrain him of personal liberty, except so far as may be necessary to secure his personal attendance.
