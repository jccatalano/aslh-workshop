614. A defendant, against whom an action is pending, upon a contract, or for specific, real, or personal property, may, at any time before answer, upon affidavit, that a person, not a party to the action, and without collusion with him, makes against him a demand for the same debt or property, apply to the court for an order to substitute such person in his place, and discharge him from liability to either party, on his depositing in court the amount of the debt, or delivering the property or its value to such person as the court may direct. And the court, after notice to the plaintifff and such person, may, in its discretion, make the order; and thereupon the substituted defendant shall stand in the place of the original defendant, and the latter be discharged from liability to either party.
