Whenever the sheriff, with an order of attachment, or with an execution against the defendant, applies to any person mentioned in the third subdivision of the last section, for the purpose of attaching or levying upon the property mentioned therein, such person must furnish him with a certificate, designating the number of rights or shares of the defendant in the stock of the corporation, with any dividend or encumbrance thereon, or the amount and description of the property held by such corporation or person, for the benefit of the defendant, or the debt owing to the defendant. If such person refuse to do so, he may be required by the court or judge to attend before him, and be examined on oath concerning the same, and disobedience to the order may be punished as a contempt.
