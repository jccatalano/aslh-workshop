106. This court, (except the city and county of New-York,) must be held by a judge of the supreme court, as the presiding judge, together with the county judge, and two justices of the sessions designated, as prescribed by other statutes, or by any two of those officers. If the justices of the sessions, or either of them, be absent at a term of the court of oyer and terrniner, or the office of those justices or either of them be vacant, the county judge may supply the vacancy or deficiency for the term, by designating the requisite number to form the court, from the justices of the peace of the county.
