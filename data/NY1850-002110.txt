189. A judge cannot act as attorney or counsel in a court of which he is a judge, or in an action or proceeding removed therefrom to another court for review. But this section does not extend to a person who acts as a judge, in virtue of his office as an alderman of a city, except in cases in which he may have acted as a member of the court.
