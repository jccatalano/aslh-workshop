1606. Upon the final report of the receiver, shewing the collection and conversion into available assets, of all the property of the insolvent, not exempt from execution, and the proper application and payment thereof, if it appear that at least twenty-five per cent of each of the insolvent’s debts contracted before his application, has been paid, or a dividend to that extent offered and set apart thereon, the court may order that the insolvent be discharged from all such debts of the following’ kinds: 1. Debts due to persons who were residents of this state at the time of the application: 2. Debts contracted in this state: 3. Debts due to creditors who have received a dividend from the receiver. But such order in no case discharges a debt arising out of a fraudulent misapplication of the property of another, nor does it affect the liability of another person who is liable jointly with the insolvent.
