1256. The publication of legal notices, required by law, or by an order of a judge or court, to be published in a newspaper once in each week, for a specified number of weeks, must be made on the first day of each week, in which such newspaper is published; and if required to be published oftener than once in each week, the second publication must be made on Thursday of each week, or if the paper be not issued and published on Thursday, then on any other day in the week on which such paper is issued. And in all cases, where a municipal corporation is required to publish legal notices, and may designate the papers in which the publication is to be made, it must make such designation annually, by ordinance, for one year, and after such designation, all such legal notices must be published in the papers so designated. The time for publication of legal notices must be computed so as to exclude the first day of publication, and to include the day on which the act or event, of which notice is given, is to happen, or which complete; the full period required for publication.
