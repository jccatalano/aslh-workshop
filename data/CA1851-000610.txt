56. It shall not be necessary for a party to set forth in a pleading
the items of an account therein alleged, but he shall deliver to the adverse party, within five days after a demand thereof in writing, a copy
of the account, or be precluded from giving evidence thereof. The
Court, or a Judge thereof, or a County Judge, may order a further
account, when the one delivered is too general, or is defective in any
particular.
