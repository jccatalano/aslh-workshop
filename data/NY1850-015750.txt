1445. No proceeding under this chapter can be had against a vessel which shall have been seized by virtue of process from a court of the United States, having admiralty jurisdiction, while such vessel is actually held under such seizure, nor against a vessel which shall have been sold by order of such court, except for debts contracted after the sale. But nothing in ‘bi’ section impairs the validity of any lien created by this chapter, the payment of which shall be decreed by a court of the United States.
