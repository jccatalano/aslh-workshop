304. When it appears that partition cannot be made equal between
the parties, according to their respective rights, without prejudice to the
rights and interests of some of them, and a partition be ordered by
judgment, the Court may adjudge compensation to be made, by one
party to another, on account of the inequality of partition. But such
compensation shall not be required to be made to others, by owners
unknown, nor by infants, unless, in case of an infant, it appear that he
has personal property sutiicient for that purpose, and that his interest
will be promoted thereby.
