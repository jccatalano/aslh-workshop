881. In an action prosecuted or defended by an executor, administrator, trustee of an express trust, or a person expressly authorized by statute, costs may be recovered as in an action by and against a person prosecuting or defending in his own right, but such costs must by the judgment be made chargeable only upon the estate, fund, or party represented, unless the court direct the same to be paid by the plaintifff or defendant, personally, for mismanagement or bad faith in the action or defense. But no costs are recoverable in such action, if brought without leave of the surrogate, against an executor or administrator within one year after the death of the person whom he represents, not after that time, unless it appear that the demand was first presented to the executor or administrator, verified by oath, and payment demanded.
