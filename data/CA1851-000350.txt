paper to be designated, as most likely to give notice to the person to be
served, and for such length of time as may be deemed reasonable, at
least once a week: Provided, that publication against a defendant
residing out of the State, or absent therefrom, shall not be less than
three months. In case of publication where the residence of a nonresident or absent defendant is known, the Court or Judge shall also
direct a copy of the summons and complaint to be forthwith deposited in
the Post oilice, directed to the person to be served, at his place of residence. When publication is ordered, personal service of a copy of the
summons and complaint, out of the State, shall be equivalent to publication and deposit in the Post office. In either case, the service of the
summons shall be deemed complete at the expiration of the time prescribed by the order for publication. In actions upon contracts for the
direct payment of money, the Court in its" discretion may, instead of
ordering publication, or may, after publication, appoint an Attorney to

appear for the non-resident, absent, or concealed defendant, and conduct
the proceedings on his part.
