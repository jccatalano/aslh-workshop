1436. After the registry of a lien, and the performance of the work, or the supply of the materials, the claimant or the owner may either serve personally upon the other, a notice in writing, requiring him to appear before a justice of the peace of the county, at a specified time, not less than five days from the time of service, and submit to an accounting for the amount due for such labor or materials. At the time mentioned in the notice, or at such other time as the accounting may be adjourned to, the parties appearing must each deliver to the justice, an account in writing of his claim or offset, if any, verified by affidavit, and submit to examination thereupon, under the direction of the justice. If both parties appear, and there arise a question of fact, a jury may be demanded by either, and such question must be tried by a jury in the same manner, as an issue joined in an ordinary action in a justiceâ€™s court. In like manner, a contractor, that is a person who contracts with the owner for labor and materials, and who employs persons under him to do work, or furnish materials, may serve on such persons, and receive from them a similar notice with the like effect; and a payment made by the owner, to a person employed by a contractor must be allowed by such contractor, in his account with the owner, to the extent of any judgment which may be recovered by such person against such contractor, pursuant to this section.
