1708. All persons, without exception, otherwise than as specified in the next two sections, who, having organs of sense, can perceive, and perceiving can make known their perceptions to others, may be witnesses. Therefore neither parties, nor other persons who have an interest in the event of an action or proceeding, are excluded; nor those who have been convicted of crime; nor persons on account of their opinions on matters of religious belief: although in every case, the credibility of the witness may be drawn in question, as provided in section 1680.
