617. When a contempt is committed in the immediate view and
presence of the Justice, it may be punished summarily, for which an
order shall be made reciting the facts, as occurring in such immediate
view and presence, adjudging that the person proceeded against is thereby
guilty of a contempt, and that he be punished as therein prescribed.
When the contempt is not committed in the immediate view and
presence of the Justice, a warrant of arrest may be issued by such
Justice, on which the person so guilty may be arrested and brought
before the Justice immediately, when an opportunity to be heard in his
defense or excuse shall be given. The Justice may thereupon discharge
him, or may convict him of the offense. A Justice may punish for contempts, by fine or imprisonment, or both; such fine not to exceed in
any case one hundred dollars, and such imprisonment one day.
