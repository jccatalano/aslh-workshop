1399. The right of a party to enforce or foreclose a mortgage, as provided in this chapter, or the validity of the mortgage, or the amount due thereon, may be contested by action, brought at any time before the sale in favor of any party interested, against any party who may attempt or threaten such foreclosure. In such action proceedings on the summary foreclosure may be stayed by injunction on such terms, as the court may direct, and in the action the court may complete the foreclosure, or not, in its discretion.
