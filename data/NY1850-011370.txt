1040. The treasurer of a county, against which, or against whose officers, a judgment has been recovered for a liability of the county, the execution of which has not been stayed upon appeal, must, upon demand, and the delivery to him of a certified copy of the docket of the judgment, pay the amount due thereon, if there be sufficient money of the county in his hands, not otherwise specifically appropriated. If he fail to do so, he shall be personally liable for the amount, unless the collection thereof be afterwards stayed upon appeal.
