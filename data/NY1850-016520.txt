If any money remain in the hands of the receiver, or be received by him, after the first dividend, he must within a year thereafter, and as much sooner as the condition of the assets will permit, after giving due notice thereof, make a second, and, if possible, final payment to the creditors, and distribution of the residue to stockholders, or others entitled, of the remaining assets in his hands. If after the second distribution, there still remain any part of the estate not collected or distributed, a third distribution must be made in like manner, and so on, as often as may be necessary; but no distribution among the stockholders can be made within one year after the appointment of the receiver, nor until after all the known debts are paid and liabilities discharged, or a sufficient fund set apart for that purpose.
