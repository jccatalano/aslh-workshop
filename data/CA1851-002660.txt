any other person, or due to the judgment debtor, to be applied towards
the satisfaction of the judgment; except that the earnings of the debtor
for his personal services, at any time within thirty days next preceding
the order, shall not be so applied, when it shall be made to appear by
the debtor’s affidavit, or otherwise, that such earnings are necessary for
the use of a family supported wholly or partly by his labor.
