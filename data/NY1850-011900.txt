When the cause of action or counterclaim arises upon an account or instrument for the payment of money only, it is sufficient for the party to deliver the account or instrument to the court, and to state, that there is due to him thereon, from the adverse party, a specified sum, which he claims to recover or set off. The court may at the time of the pleading, require that such writing or account be exhibited to the inspection of the adverse party, with liberty to copy the same; or if not so exhibited, may prohibit its being afterwards given in evidence.
