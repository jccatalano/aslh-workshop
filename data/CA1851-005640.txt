507. In an action prosecuted or defended by an executor, administrator, trustee, or express trust, or a person expressly authorized by
statute, costs may be recovered, as in action by and against a person
prosecuting or defending in his own right; but such costs shall, by the
judgment, be made chargeable only upon the estate, fund, or party
represented, unless the Court shall direct the same to be paid by the
plaintifff or defendant, personally, for mismanagement or bad faith in the
action or defense.
