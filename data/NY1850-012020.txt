1103. The trial may be adjourned by consent, or upon application of either party, without the consent of the other, for a period not exceeding eight days, as follows: 1. The party asking the adjournment must, if required by his adversary, prove by his own oath or otherwise, that he cannot, for want of material testimony, which he expects to procure, safely proceed to trial: 2. If the application be on the part of the plaintifff, and the defendant be under arrest, an adjournment for more than twenty-four hours, discharges the defendant from custody, but the action may proceed notwithstanding: and the defendant shall be subject to arrest on the execution in the same manner as if he had not been so discharged: 3. If the application be on the part of a defendant under arrest, before it can be granted, he must execute an undertaking, with one or more sufficient sureties to be approved by the justice, as follows: If the arrest be for a cause specified in the first four subdivisions of section 1071, or in the sixth, the undertaking must be to the effect, that he will appear at the return day, and not depart from the court until duly discharged, or until after the trial and judgment, and after a reasonable opportunity to arrest him on execution issued upon the judgment, if any be obtained against him. If the arrest be for a cause specified in subdivision 5, of that section, the undertaking must be to the effect, that no part of the property of the defendant, liable to be taxes on execution, shall be removed, secreted, assigned, or otherwise disposed of, except for the necessary support, for the time, of himself and family, until the plaintifff â€™s demand be satisfied, or until the expiration of ten days after the judgment, if any be obtained against him in the action: 4. Either party applying for an adjournment, must also, if required by the adverse party, consent that the testimony of any witnesses of such adverse party who are in attendance, be then taken by deposition before the justice, which must accordingly be done; and the testimony so taken may be read on the trial with the same effect, and subject to the same objections, as if the witness were produced.
