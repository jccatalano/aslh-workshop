520. An attorney has a lien for his compensation, whether specially agreed upon, or implied, as provided in this code, 1. Upon the papers of his client, which have come into his possession in the course of his professional employment: 2. Upon money in his hands belonging to his client: 3. Upon money in the hands of the adverse party, in an action or proceeding in which the attorney was employed, from the time of giving notice of the lien to that party: 4. Upon a judgment, to the extent of the costs included therein, or if there be a special agreement, to the extent of the compensation specially agreed on, from the time of giving notice to the party against whom the judgment is recovered. This lien is, however, subordinate to the rights existing between the parties to the action or proceeding.
