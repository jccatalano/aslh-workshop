755. Judgment may be had, if the defendant fail to answer the complaint, as follows: 1. In an action arising on obligation, for the recovery of money only, the plaintifff may file with the clerk, proof of personal service of the summons, and that no answer has been received. The clerk must thereupon enter judgment for the amount mentioned in the summons, against the defendant, or against one or more of several defendants, in the cases provided for in section 632; 2. In other actions, the plaintifff may, upon the like proof, apply to the court, after the expiration of the time for answering, for the relief demanded in the complaint. If the taking of an account or the proof of any fact be necessary to enable the court to give judgment, or to carry the judgment into effect, the court may take the account or hear the proof, or may, in its discretion, order a reference for that purpose. And where the action is for the recovery of money only, or of specific, real or personal property, with damages for the withholding thereof; the court may order the damages to be assessed by a jury, or if the examination of a long account be involved, by a reference as above provided; 3. In actions, where the service of the summons was by publication, the plaintifff may in like manner apply for judgment, and the court must thereupon require proof to be made of the demand mentioned in the complaint, and if the defendant be not a resident of the state, must require the plaintifff or his agent to be examined on oath, respecting any payments that have been made to the plaintifff or to any one for his use on account of such demand, and may render judgment for the amount which he is entitled to recover. Before judgment the plaintifff must give satisfactory security, to abide the order of the court, touching the restitution of any property collected or received under the judgment, in case the defendant or his representatives are admitted to defend the action, and succeed in the defense.
