421. A party examined by an adverse party, as in this chapter
provided, may be examined on his own behalf in respect to any matter
pertinent to the issue. But if he testify to any new matter not responsive to the inquiries put to him by the adverse party, or necessary to
explain or qualify his answer thereto; or to discharge, when his answer
would charge himself, such adverse party may offer himself as a witness on his own behalf in respect to such new matter; and shall be so
received.
