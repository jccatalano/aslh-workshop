377. Parties to a question in difference, which might be the sub- â€˜
ject of a civil action, may, without action, agree upon a case containing 1
the facts upon which the controversy depends, and present a submission '
of the same to any Court which should have jurisdiction, if an action
had been brought. But it must appear, by athdavit, that the controversy is real, and the proceedings in good faith, to determine the rights
of the parties. The Court shall thereupon hear and determine
the case, and render judgment thereon, as if an action were
depending.
