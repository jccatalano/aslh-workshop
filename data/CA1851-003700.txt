338. When the party who has the right to appeal wishes a state
ment of the case to be annexed to the record of the judgment or order,
he shall, within twenty days after the entry of such judgment or order,
prepare such statement, which shall contain the grounds upon which he
intends to rely on the appeal, and so much of the evidence as may be
necessary to explain the grounds, and no more; and shall serve a copy
thereof upon the adverse party. The respondent may, within five days
thereafter, prepare amendments to the statement, and serve a copy on
the appellant. If such amendments are admitted, the statement shall
be corrected accordingly; and if not admitted, the statement and
amendments shall be presented to the Judge who tried or heard the
case, upon notice of two days to the respondent, and a true statement
shall thereupon be settled by such Judge.
