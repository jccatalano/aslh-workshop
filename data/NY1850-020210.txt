1852. The jury, subject to the control of the court, in the cases specified in this code, are the judges of the effect or value of evidence addressed to them, except when it is hereby declared to be conclusive. They are however to be instructed by the court, on all proper occasions; I. That their power of judging of the effect of evidence is not arbitrary, but to be exercised with legal discretion, and in subordination to the rules of evidence; 2. That they are not bound to decide in conformity with the declarations of any number of witnesses, which do not produce conviction in their minds, against a less number, or against a presumption or other evidence satisfying their minds; 3. That a witness, false in one part of his testimony, is to be distrusted in others; 4. That the testimony of an accomplice ought to be viewed with distrust, and the oral admissions of a party with caution: 5. That in civil cases the affirmative of the issue must be proved, and when the evidence is contradictory, the decision must be made according to the preponderance of evidence; that in criminal cases, guilt must be established beyond reasonable doubt; 6. That evidence is to be estimated, not only by its own intrinsic weight, but also according to the evidence which it is in the power of one side to produce, and of the other to contradict, and thereforee, 7. That if weaker and less satisfactory evidence is offered, when it appears that stronger and more satisfactory was within the power of the party, the evidence offered should be viewed with distrust.
