830. Where a judgment requires the payment of money or the delivery of real or personal property, the same is enforced in those respects by execution, as provided in the last three sections. Where it requires the performance of any other act, a certified copy of the judgment may be served upon the party against whom it is given, or upon the person or officer who is required thereby, or by law, to obey the same, and his obedience thereto enforced. If he refuse, he may be punished by the court, as for a contempt.
