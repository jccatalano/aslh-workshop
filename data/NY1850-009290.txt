A sale must be made by auction, between nine oâ€™clock in the morning and sunset; after sufficient property has been sold to satisfy the execution, no more must be sold; neither the officer holding the execution nor his deputy can purchase; when the sale is of personal property, capable of manual delivery, it must be within view of those who attend the sale, and be sold in such places as are likely to bring the highest price; and when the sale is of real property, and consisting of several known lots, or parcels, they must be sold separately, or when a portion of such real property is claimed by a third person, and he requires it to be sold separately, such portion must be thus sold.
