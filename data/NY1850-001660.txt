149. If the judge authorized to hold or preside at a city court for the exercise of either its civil or criminal jurisdiction, be disqualified from holding the court, as provided in section 188, he must, upon the request of either party, file with the county clerk a certificate, stating the fact constituting the disqualification and directing that the action or proceeding, if civil, be transferred to the supreme court, or if criminal, to the court of oyer and terminer of the county, and it must be transferred accordingly. If he refuse to do so, the supreme court, at a special term in the district, or a judge thereof, may, upon motion after due notice, order the transfer to be made.
