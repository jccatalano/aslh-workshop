1750. A public seal in this state is a stamp or impression made upon wax, wafer, paper, or any other substance, upon which a visible and permanent impression can be made. A private seal may be made in the same manner, or it may be made, without an impression, by a wafer or wax attached to the instrument or by a paper attached to it by an adhesive substance. A scroll or other sign, made in a sister state or foreign country, and there recognized as a seal, must be so regarded in this state, except for a transfer of real property, in this state.
