1396. If the evidence be defective it may be amended or supplied. If it appear, that one or more parcels were sold, after a sum had been raised sufficient to satisfy the amount due with costs, the sale as to those parcels may be vacated, and in other respects confirmed. The omission to serve notice on persons other than the mortgagor, and his personal representatives, shall not affect the validity of the foreclosure and sale, in respect to the persons upon whom the notice was served. But a sale not confirmed as provided in this chapter is void, any money paid thereon must be restored, and the judge by order may enforce the restoration.
