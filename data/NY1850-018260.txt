It may be received, subject to be rejected as incompetent, unless connected with the fact in dispute, by proof of other facts. For example, on an issue of title to real property, evidence of the continued possession of a remote occupant is partial, for it is of a detached fact, which may or may not be afterwards connected with the fact in dispute.
