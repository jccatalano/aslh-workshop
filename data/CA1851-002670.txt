244. If it appear that a person or corporation alleged to have property of the judgment debtor, or indebted to him, claims an interest in the
property adverse to him, or denies the debt, the Court or Judge may'
authorize, by an order made to that effect, the judgment creditor to institute an action against such person or corporation, for the recovery of such
interest or debt; and the Court or Judge may, by order, forbid a transfer or other disposition of such interest or debt, until an action can be
commenced and prosecuted to judgment. Such order may be modified
or vacated by the Judge granting the same, or the Court in which the
action is brought, at any time upon such terms as may be just. â€™
